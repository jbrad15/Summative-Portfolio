    <p> OK, so the first project I chose is the first project I did for this course. The elements of this project that I will continue 
    to use are the fundamentals I learned while creating this, how to use shapes, colouring things and planning a project. The aprt of
    this module that impacted me most are the basics I learned while coding it, learning how to use Khan Academy and the improtance.</p>
    
   <p> The second project is one of the modules that were required. The elements of this project that I will continue to use are
    all of the CSS basics displayed in the project some example text and background colouring, adding images to a webpage and using ids     and and classes. This module showed me the basics of creating websites and the biggest impact of this module on me is that I've now 
    realised that I'm a much bigger fan of coding programs as opposed to making a website.</p>  
    
   <p> The third project I've chosen is the Bookshelf maker it is part of the JS objects module. I chose this one because it introduced 
    me to a very important concept that will be extreamly useful in my future, objects and object oriented design. This 
    will have a big impact on me because in my future a lot of the coding I will do will be object oriented design and all of the 
    object stuff I learn now will help me out in university as well.</p>

   <p> This is another one of the modules that was required. The information within this module has shown me new ways to think about
    a few different topics. First sorting, I've learned about sorting algorthims before but this was very in-depth and the other 
  thing was a new way of graphing and 2-D matrices. This will impact me as a student because algorthims are a complicated concept that I 
    will learn about once I get to university and a headstart is always good. </p>
    
   <p> Fifth thing I've got to show you is the Blog Post project. I chose it because it taught me a two of very important parts 
    of website coding, those skills are linking offsite (see the list of modules) and internal linking. These skills will impact me as a
    student because this module, among others, has helped me build a foundation for how to create websites.</p>
    
   <p> The sixth project I've got here is the evolution of #5, it's pretty much the next level of it. This project taught me another 
    important concept that is pivitol to web design that being making tables and organizing infromation. This will have the same impact 
    on me as the previous one and helped build on the aforementioned website develpoment.</p>
    
   <p> The seventh project I have to show you is the final one that was required. In the module I learned a few things about
    natural simulations and stats. This project showed me 2 skills one it taught me how to add randomness to a program and second
    it taught me a little bit about stats. Knowing how to introduce randomness to a program is an important skill to have because 
    it allows you do create movement that is much more complex than just x++: for example. The stats pat of this simulation was also
    improtant for me because statistics and data mangament are a part of my university degree.</p>
    
   <p> Number 8 is the Magic 8 Ball (hehehe), in this module I coded an amazing prophecy ball that gives great advice. In this
   module I learned about random numbers, fonts and conditional if statements. These skills are improtant for me because great
  groundwork for my future JS coding. This module has lots of impact for me because it continues to lay the groundwork for my future
  coding endeavours.</p>

  <p> Project 9 is my the fish tank, in this project I made a program that drew a bunch of fish. This project taugh me how to use
  functions to draw an image repeatedly, how to manipulate variables within a function and how to make designs with shapes.
  These skills are important because they are a great foundation for how to use functions and a good setup for passing variables
  into the function.</p>
  
  <p> The final part of portfolio is the challenge called flower grower. I chose this challenge because it is pretty much the 
  culmination of everything I've learned in JS. This challenge has a little bit of everything it has passing variables into and out
  of function, objects, classes, mouse interaction and shape drawing among other things. This challenge impacts me as a student because
  it shows all of my knoledge of JS and will be a great fundation for the things I learn in university.</p>
