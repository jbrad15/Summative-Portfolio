    <p> OK, so the first project I chose is the first project I did for this course. The elements of this project that I will continue 
    to use are the fundamentals I learned while creating this, how to use shapes, colouring things and planning a project. The aprt of
    this module that impacted me most are the basics I learned while coding it, learning how to use Khan Academy and the improtance.</p>
    
    <p> The second project is one of the modules that were required. The elements of this project that I will continue to use are
    all of the CSS basics displayed in the project some example text and background colouring, adding images to a webpage and using ids and
    and classes. This module showed me the basics of creating websites and the biggest impact of this module on me is that I've now 
    realised that I'm a much bigger fan of coding programms as opposed to making a website.</p>  
    
    <p> The third project I've chosen is the Bookshelf maker it is part of the JS objects module. I chose this one because it introduced 
    me to a very important concept that will be extreamly useful in my future, objects and object oriented design. This 
    will have a big impact on me because in my future a lot of the coding I will do will be object oriented design and all of the 
    object stuff I learn now will help me out in university as well.</p>
    
    <p> This is another one of the modules that was required. The information within this module has shown me new ways to think about
    a few different topics. First sorting, I've learned about sorting algorthims before but this was very in-depth and the other thing was
    a new way of graphing and 2-D matrices. This will impact me as a student because algorthims are a complicated concept that I will learn 
    about once I get to university and a headstart is always good. </p>
